# Bytecode Diffs

This directory holds old bytecode generations to compare against new compiler updates to ensure that the generations that should stay constant, stay constant.

The `features` directory holds the individual features and cases that should be tested, and are added manually.

The `records` directory is the default for the diff cli, and contains only auto-generated content. Do not change the contents of records.
