// heap allocation
// allocating to the heap works by using the 'new' keyword taking the following expression,
// evaluating it, then allocating space on the heap and moving it there. If the value is
// constant, or does not rely on an expression being evaluated, the new keyword will first
// allocate space on the heap then write into that instead of first the stack then moving
// using the 'new' keyword returns a pointer to the resulting type of the expression
